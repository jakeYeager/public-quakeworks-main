# The Earth Tide Phenomenon

The Earth tide is a little known effect on the Earth's crust from the influence of the Sun and Moon's gravity. The vertical height of the Earth tide is very slight; the ground moves a distance only measured in centimeters. But the total displacement is vast; the Earth tide [deforms the shape](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth_tide#Body_tide) of the planet, crust and all. This displacement largely goes unnoticed, though it can effect sensitive equipment that uses precise telemetry calculations, such as GPS satellite stations.

Looking at large volumes of earthquake occurrences it is possible to see that there is a trend in their activity, a trend that indicates an influence by the Earth tide. 

But how does this work? What's the mechanism?

## Change in Stress

Imagine an old wooden pirate ship pitching on stormy seas. As the ship pitches up a wave, it's whole shape is put under stress responding to the mountain of water; the boards that create the shape of the ship become stressed and racked under this deformation ...and the boards creak.

As the boat falls back down the other side of the wave, the ship's boards groan as they relax back to their intended position.

If we use this wooden ship as a conceptual model, with the ship being the Earth, the sea waves being the gravitational influences, and the creak/groans being earthquakes, then we could have a model for seemly random earthquakes being environmentally induced events.

This is the core concept behind the Earth-tide almanac. If earthquakes are the creaks and groans of tectonic plates rubbing together then by using them as indicators, or movement proxies, it could be possible to observe the “tossing ship” or, more literally, the deformation cycle of the Earth by gravitational influences.
