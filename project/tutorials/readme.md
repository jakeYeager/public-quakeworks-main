## Video 1: Overview

### Conceptual overview of the Earth-tide almanac project

**Video topics:** "Are earthquakes randomly distributed through time?" There is a subtle pattern inherent in ALL earthquakes that is only revealed through testing very large data sets. This pattern appears when looking at the relationship between the Sun and the Earth's crust.

## Video 2: Chaotic, not random

**Video topics:** Earthquakes are shown to more likely be chaotic than random in this initial demonstration. Real earthquake data is compared to randomly generated data, with the focus on hour of occurrence. The data plot used is the region of Java in Southeast Asia. Also, a comparison between pseudo random vs true random is explored.

## Video 3: Time has topography

**Video topics:** concept of the Earth tide; crust of the Earth is very thin and is attached to malleable asthenosphere and upper mantle; Earth tide is a deformation of the planetary shape that is very slight, but pervasive; gravitational force of the Sun binds or clamps faults, and fault-binding travels over the face of the globe as the Earth rotates; potentially as the Sun's position changes latitude over the course of a year, the binding of the faults could be effected at different times of the year.

## Video 4: Almanac layout

**Video topics:** a look inside an Earth-tide almanac to explore the layout and visualizations. Different charts types: the chron-table, the stack, the equalizer and the matrix. Introduction to the "Marker" calendar as position-of-orbit framework rather than a time-keeping calendar. Viable periods based on available data. Activity gradients begin to appear showing not only times of year that are more active but also more volatile.

## Video 5: Pressure signature

**Video topics:** looking at an Earth-tide almanac for a specific profiled region. Earthquakes as chaotic events that can occur at any point in time yet seem to be expressed at certain times of year more than others. Seismic risk is constant throughout the year, but some periods appear more at-risk.
